Coffee Sales Dashboard

Description:
I downloaded a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing information on coffee sales across various countries. The dataset included details such as the types of coffee sold, sales volumes, and geographic distribution. After downloading the dataset, I performed extensive data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing any anomalies.

With the cleaned dataset, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the sales of different types of coffee across various countries. The dashboard provides insights into:

Sales Performance: Track and compare the sales performance of different coffee types, such as espresso, latte, cappuccino, and more.
Geographic Distribution: Visualize coffee sales data across different countries to identify top-performing regions.
Trend Analysis: Observe sales trends over time, helping to forecast future sales and identify seasonal patterns.
Market Insights: Gain insights into customer preferences and market demand for various types of coffee in different countries.
The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and strategize effectively based on the insights provided.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Data Source: Kaggle
Data Cleaning: Excel, Python (Pandas)
Dashboard Creation: Excel, Power BI / Tableau
This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, clean and process it, and present actionable insights through an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
